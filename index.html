            <p class="descriptions">I am a high school senior from New York, and before high school, I thought NY would be the only place I'd ever call home. This all changed during the summer of 2017, however, when I joined a program called <a href="https://www.prepforprep.org/admissions/prep-9-7th-grade" target="_blank"><em>PREP 9</em></a>, and underwent 14 months of grueling and extensive preparation for boarding school, a form of education I was unaware of at the time.<!-- Through the course of 14 excruciating months, my contingent(CONTINGENT XXXI REPRESENT!!!) and I gave up two of our summer vacations and our weekends during the school year in order to be academically and mentally prepared for boarding school. As I'm sure you have gathered, PREP was a huge time commitment, and I had to make countless sacrifices in order to attend PREP, from little things like missing my friend's party to more significant things like passing up on extracurriculars that may take up too much of my time. Being only 13 during my time at PREP, there were many accounts where I wasn't ready to make sacrifices, leading me to consider quitting PREP, but looking back at how PREP has helped me advance, I can gurantee quitting would have been a grave, if not the worst, decision of my life.--> Through PREP, I received the humbling oppurtunity to receive a world-class education at one of the most prestigious preparatory schools in the world, <a href="https://www.andover.edu/" target="_blank"><em>Phillips Academy</em></a>. <!--After the initial phase of culture shock, as this was my first ever experience of living within a predominantly white community, attending PA has been an incredible experience, and I have definitely grown as a student, and more importantly as a human being.--> PA has been a very demanding school in terms of both academics and extracurriculars,<!-- and as crazy as this may sound, I am grateful for it,--> pushing me to limits I never thought I could reach and finding pursuits I would have disregarded otherwise, including a new found passion for computer science! With the help of PREP, I discovered <a href="https://www.allstarcode.org/" target="_blank"><em>All Star Code</em></a>, a program designed to teach young men of color the fundamentals of coding and the professional skills necessary for our future careers. Throughout these past 3 years, I have gained valuable resources and experiences from PREP, PA, and ASC, and with all the lessons they have taught me, I know I am bound to suceed!  </p>

            <p class="descriptions">I am a rising junior from New York, and until two years ago, I thought NY would be the only place I'd ever call home. This all changed during the summer of 2018, however, when I joined a program called PREP 9, and underwent 14 months of grueling and extensive prepation for boarding school, a form of education I was unaware about at the time. In those 14 excruciating months, my contingent(CONTINGENT XXXI REPRESENT!!!) and I gave up two of our summers and our weekends during the school year in order to be academically and mentally prepared for boarding school.</p>
